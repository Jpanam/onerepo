# The Evolution of ShapeShift

Since our formation in 2014, our purpose has been to empower the digital asset market in alignment with the ethos of financial sovereignty.

Seven years ago, we pioneered frictionless crypto trading with no user accounts, and no custody of user funds.

- In 2017, we acquired KeepKey to bring easy cold-storage to our users.
- In 2018, we built a full self-custody crypto interface that incorporated KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor hardware wallets with integrated trading functionality across chains.
- In 2019, we removed all commissions for holders of the FOX Token.
- In 2020, we acquired Portis to further engage with the burgeoning web3 dapp ecosystem and released ShapeShift’s self-custody mobile app.
- And by late 2020, we began integrating decentralized protocols directly into the ShapeShift crypto platform to enable immutable, borderless trading with no intermediary, removing ourselves—and our prior business model—from the process.

This evolution enabled us to return protection and dignity to our users, ending KYC and other intrusive financial surveillance practices. ShapeShift will never be a bank. The end goal has been and remains: a world where people are empowered to manage their own financial futures, without sacrificing their privacy and control to governmental and middlemen entities. A world where users can participate in and explore new voluntary forms of financial innovation.

> It has become clear to us that decentralization is the only way to achieve borderless, immutable finance. Therefore, decentralizing ShapeShift is how we choose to maintain fidelity to the principles first established by Satoshi and the Bitcoin whitepaper.

Starting today, our process of decentralization will occur in steps:

- It means ShapeShift will, over time, go fully open-source. 
- It means ShapeShift will dismantle its entire corporate structure in a way that respects our shareholders and empowers our employees.
- It means the ownership and governance over ShapeShift’s future moves to the broad and decentralized community of FOX Token holders, starting now.

To our knowledge, no established company has ever decentralized itself to this degree. This is new ground that we hope will inspire others as well.

It is with great enthusiasm and gratitude to the many pioneers around us that we begin this next phase of ShapeShift’s journey.

We begin this new phase from a position of strength. Since 2014, ShapeShift has grown to support a broad community of users and has facilitated a vast number of crypto transactions (as of the end of May 2021):

We’ve continually evolved to offer users access to a range of widely requested, innovative  services and capabilities, without friction:  

- Trading via 0x DEX aggregation with the best rates available
- Cross-chain swaps, including native BTC to ETH, via THORChain integration
- Earn interest by providing FOX & ETH liquidity on Uniswap V2
- Fully non-custodial, including our secure native software wallet
- Accessible with KeepKey and most prominent hardware wallets including Ledger and Trezor
- Fast and private, with no account or KYC required

# FOX Superpower: Governance

The FOX Token has always been our way of giving extra utility to those who support the ShapeShift platform and community (starting with no trading fees in 2019). Now, FOX is becoming the entire control and ownership structure of the project.

With time, governance over the entire ShapeShift open-source platform will move to FOX holders. This will be a process in which decision making moves from the fully centralized shareholder/board structure of ShapeShift today to a fully decentralized community/token structure in the future.

FOX holders will eventually govern all important decisions of the project. This includes governing the ShapeShift DAO—a new DAO treasury endowed with over 240,000,000 FOX Tokens (24% of all FOX).

What types of decisions could ShapeShift DAO governance control going forward?

- Which protocols and assets to integrate.
- How to spend or invest funds in the ShapeShift DAO, such as:
  - Funding community initiatives like liquidity mining, Rainfall, FOX Fuel, and FOX rewards or other new initiatives.
  - Which products or services to build.
  - Hiring contractors to build those products or services (and selecting those hired).
- Whether to add or change fees for using the ShapeShift interface (currently, ShapeShift does not add any fees but has the capability to turn these on). Examples of this today include: fees on 0x trades, fees on THORChain trades, fees on LP tx’s through THORChain, and fees on fiat purchases through Banxa.
- And any other ideas contributed by our customers and community.

FOX hodlers are encouraged to engage—discuss and debate ideas, brainstorm the optimal path forward, suggest a route change to the roadmap. Please see the “Important Links” section below for the ShapeShift community chat on Discord, the ShapeShift Discourse forum, and ShapeShift’s governance portal on Boardroom, where we will focus all open discussion and communications for the decentralized community.

ShapeShift will establish a well-funded non-profit organization—a Foundation—with the narrow objective to promote and facilitate a transition to a completely decentralized, community-owned project. As sufficient decentralization is achieved, this Foundation has a mandate to dissolve away.

The ShapeShift DAO is powered by SafeSnap (SnapShot + Gnosis Safe), which means community members can propose and vote on proposals with zero gas fees, and the result of those votes can trigger on-chain transactions.

Voting power applies to those with FOX in their wallets and will soon be upgraded to include FOX in the FOX/ETH Liquidity Pool on Uniswap V2.
