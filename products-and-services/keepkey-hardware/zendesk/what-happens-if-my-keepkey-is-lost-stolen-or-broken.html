<h1>What Happens if My KeepKey is Lost, Stolen or Broken?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p>In the event that your device is lost, stolen or broken you can use your 12-word recovery sentence to restore all of your assets. As long as you have a strong PIN enabled on your KeepKey, your device is useless in the hands of a thief.</p>
<p>If you do not have multiple accounts, you can recover your digital assets on any wallet that is BIP39 compatible. If you have more than one account, you can recover in any wallet that is BIP44 compatible.<br><br></p>
<p><em><strong>Here are some BIP44 compatible wallets that you may find helpful:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Exodus</li>
<li>JAXX</li>
<li>CoPay</li>
<li>Coinomi</li>
<li>MyCelium</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
