<h1>End of KeepKey Chrome App - Do Not Use</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p>Beginning in June 2020, Google will be ending support for the Chrome Apps. We recommend all KeepKey Chrome App Client users move to the ShapeShift Platform. The platform allows you to send, receive, trade, and securely hold your KeepKey assets.</p>
<p>The following assets will not be supported on the ShapeShift Platform when Google ends Chrome App support - BTG and the following ERC20s: AELF, CyberMiles, Kucoin Shares, QTUM, ODEM</p>
<p>We recommend using the KeepKey integration with MyEtherWallet for ERC-20 support.<br>For BTG support we suggest moving your assets to a different wallet, though they will remain safe on KeepKey after support ends.</p>
<p><strong>You may be wondering "But the KeepKey Client lets me do some things that the ShapeShift platform does not." Rest assured, the following changes will be made to the ShapeShift platform:</strong></p>
<p>-Change PIN and being able to recover will be available in June.<br>-Change timeout and check recover will come at a later date.<br>-Change device label is gone for good.</p>
