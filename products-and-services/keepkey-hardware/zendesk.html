<h1>Why Am I Experiencing Connectivity Issues?</h1>

<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p>There are a few reasons that you may experience connectivity issues. If your KeepKey is not connecting properly, try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarting your router and computer.</li>
<li>Using another USB cable.</li>
<li>Check to see if you have antivirus installed. This may be the root cause of your issue. To test this, you can temporarily disable your antivirus software. Note: If that resolves the issue, please add your KeepKey as a trusted device.</li>
<li>Check your VPN. If you are using one, I recommend temporarily disabling it.</li>
</ul>
