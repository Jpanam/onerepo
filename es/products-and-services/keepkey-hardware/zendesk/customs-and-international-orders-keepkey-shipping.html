<h1>Customs and International Orders (KeepKey Shipping)</h1>
<p>International orders are generally subject to local import duties and taxes (VAT). We are not responsible for, nor can we offer, any specific advice regarding any customs related fees that you may incur. For specific information, please consult with your local government import office.<br><br>If you return a product to us, you will be the exporter from the destination country. Title and risk of loss transfer to us upon our receipt of the merchandise. Shipping carriers will assist you in recovering your taxes and duties for a fee. Please contact shipping carriers directly to initiate this service.<br><br>Your privacy is important to us. We strive to exceed your expectations for privacy. Cross-border shipments are subject to inspection by customs authorities. We may also be called upon to provide certain order, shipment, and product information to our international carriers. Carriers may communicate such information to customs authorities for the purpose of facilitating customs clearance and compliance with local laws.<br><br>Cross-border shipments going through customs inspections can delay delivery. These delays are out of our control as well as the carriers. Please check with your local government import office to determine what you can expect for any delays associated with the arrival of your order.<br><br>We only collect Washington sales tax for orders shipped to a Washington state address. Sales tax is not a VAT, and cannot be recovered by non-US residents when returning home.</p>
