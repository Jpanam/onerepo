## Visio
We envision a borderless financial system built on open, decentralized protocols.

## Mission
We shall be the pathway into this borderless financial system; an open-source, multi-chain, self-custody crypto platform enabling billions to achieve financial sovereignty.

## Values

**Trustworthy** - We are upfront and transparent. We are fair and accurate in our dealings with one another and with our customers. We earn trust with time and execution, rather than by expecting it by default.

**Collaborative** - We are talented individuals aligning behind unified strategies to build greatness. We support, encourage, and challenge each other. We leverage the force multiplier of teamwork.

**Adaptive** - We are a decentralized startup in an experimental new industry straight out of a sci-fi novel. We embrace volatility. We observe, react, endure, and move through every challenge and obstacle brought upon us.

**Spirited** - We are playful and passionate. We engage sincerely with one another and with the world. We pour art, character, and conviction into our products and believe crypto, like speech, is best when borderless.

**Pioneering** - We innovate with digital tools, along the frontier of distributed finance. Casting off from the paternalistic comfort of a permissioned world, we build in the wilds, readying sanctuary from the dark clouds of fiatâ€™s twilight hour. We expect maturity, grit, and stoic resolve.
