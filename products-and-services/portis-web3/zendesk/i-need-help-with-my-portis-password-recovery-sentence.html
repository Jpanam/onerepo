<h1>I Need Help With My Portis Password/Recovery Sentence.</h1>
<div class="article-body"><p><span>When registering a Portis account, you create a wallet, which is immediately encrypted client-side with a secret that was generated from your password. This password never leaves your device. The Portis servers safeguard only user-encrypted wallets, so you can rest assured that nobody but you can access your wallet or sign any transactions without your consent. However, because the private key used to encrypt your recovery phrase is derived from the password you pick, if you lose your password <strong>and</strong> recovery phrase, your funds are lost forever.&nbsp;</span><span>As long as you have access to either, you have control of your funds!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So please - log in and back up that phrase somewhere safe. It is your only way to reset your password in case you forget it.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do I See My Recovery Sentence?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Once you’re connected to your Portis wallet, head to the “Settings” tab of the platform: </span><strong><a href="https://beta.shapeshift.com/settings">https://beta.shapeshift.com/settings</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Click the drop-down arrow.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>You will be redirected to: </span><strong><a href="https://wallet.portis.io/recovery-phrase">https://wallet.portis.io/recovery-phrase</a></strong><span> where your recovery sentence is visible. For security, please be sure you are alone when viewing your recovery sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>In the event that you forget/lose your password, you’ll need both the email address associated with your account as well as your recovery sentence.</strong></p>
<p><span>For more settings, visit </span><a href="https://wallet.portis.io/"><span><strong>wallet.portis.io</strong></span></a><span>. From there you can enable/disable 2FA, change password, view recovery phrase, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
