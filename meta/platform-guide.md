# How to Begin Translation

Hopefully this document will be easier to follow.
<br>

## Logging in and Finding Bounties

**1. Proceed to the login page and enter your credentials.**

**2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to a page with the workstream's translation queue.  Take a look around and see what's currently available for work and payment. Click the link to the document(s) that is ready for translation.**

**None. Ideally the English version of the document should be completely ready before you translating into other languages. This can be seen by the indicator lights beneath the language locales in the table. 

(Green means ready, yellow means started, and red means work has not started.)**

## Preparing a Document for Translation

**3. There are a couple ways to prepare a document for translation. As long as you follow the simple file naming rules that will be explained soon, everything should be easy to pick up and learn.**

**4. Method 1:  Duplicating the page from the topbar. Next to the globe icon, you'll see another icon called "Actions."**

**5. Select "Duplicate" from the dropdown menu.**

**6. Method 2: From the quick action menu at the bottom right of the page. Simply hover over the icon with the pencil, and a vertical menu will pop out. Select `Duplicate`.**

## Language Configuration and File Naming

**7. Once you begin the duplication process, you'll be presented with this screen. This screen shows the current repository and all its pages and folder structuring. Feel free to take a look around the English repository to get an idea of how folder structuring works.**

**8. When you're ready to finish the duplication process and begin the translation process, click the button near the bottom left.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/854a53dc-6199-4afa-a0a9-c6d59a78d560/cropped_screenshot_$1633547017.jpeg)

**9. Click here:**

**None. Heads Up! The next part is very easy once you understand it, but it's often overlooked. Pay special attention to this part.**

**10. If you look carefully at the original English document that was duplicated,  the document path was (EN) "/shapeshift/shapeshift-company." After selecting your language code (RU in this example), you must copy the same folder and document naming structure! Otherwise when the files are synced with Git, your beautifully written work will not be picked up and the admins will have to manually fix the issue, Not a huge deal, but it should not be a common occurrence. **

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/9ce5d5a8-8deb-4b12-a5fd-91a88e51876d/cropped_screenshot_$1633547020.jpeg)

**None. Since the original document was: 
(EN) "/shapeshift/shapeshift-company" 
the respective Russian version will simply be:
(RU) "/shapeshift/shapeshift-company"
No changes to the name or structure, only the locale language code has changed.**

**11. Once you set the locale and the folder + doc name correctly, go ahead and select the button to move us to the next step.**

**None. Notice how in the screenshot above that there is no folder or documents? That's because each language has its own namespace, meaning each language maintains its own set of files. This reduces clutter and chance of overwrite errors, and makes for easy synchronization as well as future expansion.  **

**12. You'll be taken to a new page where you'll be translating the document. Since we've already set the language and file structuring settings, there's no need to touch it again. 

You should, however, translate the title and description of the document.**

**13. As well as relevant tags! **

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/a016d783-0a58-4ac3-87aa-7669a0070673/cropped_screenshot_$1633547021.jpeg)

**14. In this example, we'll add the tag "ShapeShift" by typing "ShapeShift [[enter]]"**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/43c2ae96-ac86-4418-87f5-af20e7546233/cropped_screenshot_$1633547022.jpeg)

**15. And you can see that the tag was added successfully. All contributors are encouraged to be as descriptive as possible and add as many relevant tags as possible, as it helps the backend's ML search engine.**

## Pushing the File to Draft Mode

**16. Once you're done with this section, head on over to the next section by clicking the second tab.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/046c5c24-9501-4a28-854e-e54681073556/cropped_screenshot_$1633547025.jpeg)

**17. [[Switch the toggle]],  to indicate that this is a draft document in progress. Once you are done translating the entire document we can "uncheck" this and publish it to the live site.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/d2fcdcd2-5d9a-4f90-94c4-5d63d02e0fd1/cropped_screenshot_$1633547025.jpeg)

**18. And we're ready!**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/b4773b48-3978-48ce-bd8d-79442ef817a7/cropped_screenshot_$1633547026.jpeg)

## Translating the Document

**19. Most documents will be created and translated in markdown syntax (.md files). The left pane is the actual editor, and the right pane is the preview of the rendering. You can hide the right pane by [[clicking the icon]], if you wish to do so.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/041824c9-b8f0-4388-a3a6-5553a9d8d712/cropped_screenshot_$1633547026.jpeg)

**20. You can also turn spellcheck on and off with this button, but the efficacy of the function outside of the English language is not known.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/d087f297-27cd-4f3b-a27d-f3df67d34409/cropped_screenshot_$1633547028.jpeg)

**21. In some cases you may need to add media files such as images or videos. This can be done with the media manager, accessed by the icon on the left.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/4499ae3a-804c-4d8b-9d58-a63140d4d85d/cropped_screenshot_$1633547028.jpeg)

**22. Once you are done uploading you can insert the file into the document. In most cases, however, there will not be a need to manage files at all.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/37d31693-bc64-4b9e-ad40-d2fd291c9227/cropped_screenshot_$1633547029.jpeg)

**23. Again, double check to make sure that you are translating to the correct language and document structure (location) is set correctly.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/0dc7cef2-e89b-426e-8101-0bc82f3f779a/cropped_screenshot_$1633547030.jpeg)

**24. If everything is looking good and you feel confident, press the icon with the green checkmark to begin the syncing process with our local servers as well as Git.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/99bd562c-3024-47ef-ac6e-f11cd8465aa3/cropped_screenshot_$1633547030.jpeg)

## Publishing (Pushing) the Document Live

**25. Let's pretend this document has been fully translated into Russian and is ready to publish.  The green button will push your document live only if you mark the document as ready.  In step #17 we checked an item to set the document as a draft. Do the same process, except this time [[untoggle]] the option.**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/scribe_documents/5e0df61e-fb10-4e58-bc7c-adc44b7e164d/actions/15847cda-86b8-452f-9730-9df494f13bf9/cropped_screenshot_$1633552048.png)

**26. Now we are ready to push the document live! Go ahead and [[Publish!]]

This will set into motion the push and syncing of the document in three different buckets (local db, Git, and a off-server FS). Peer reviewers will be summoned to evaluate the quality, and twice a month rewards will be paid out.**
