<h1>Mi KeepKey no se conecta a ShapeShift. ¿Qué debo hacer?</h1>
<p>Si su KeepKey no se conecta a ShapeShift, hay algunos pasos que puede seguir. Primero, asegúrese de que no está ejecutando una VPN o un programa antivirus. A continuación, intente estos pasos en orden.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Close all programs that detect the KeepKey, except ShapeShift. If you have the KeepKey Updater App open, close it. Refresh and click "Connect Wallet" again once you've done this.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the first step didn't work, try upgrading your Firmware via the Updater App. The Updater App will tell you what Firmware version and Bootloader version you are on. You should be on <strong>Firmware 6.4.0 and Bootloader 1.1.0&nbsp;</strong>or later. You can download the most recent versions of the Updater App here:<br>&nbsp;</li>

  <li><strong>Mac: </strong><a href="http://beta.shapeshift.com/keepkey-updater-mac.dmg">http://beta.shapeshift.com/keepkey-updater-mac.dmg</a><br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Go to "Settings" and then find the section that says "Linked Wallet" and select the dropdown arrow. Next, you will want to select "Forget". After that, you can reconnect your wallet.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the above steps haven't worked, it may be a simpler fix. Restart your computer, try a different USB port, and try a new micro-USB cable.<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Our final troubleshooting step is to clear your cache and history. Here is how to do this:<br><br>- In the Chrome browser, click "History" in the top left side of the screen.<br>- Click "Show Full History".<br>- On the left side, you will see a button to click called "Clear Browsing Data".<br>- Click "Clear Data" and your history/cache will be cleared.</li>
</ol>
