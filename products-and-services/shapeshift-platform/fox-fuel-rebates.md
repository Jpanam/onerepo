# FOX Fuel - Introduction

ShapeShift will now help cover your gas costs on trades by reimbursing you with FOX.

Gas fees can be expensive when using DEXes to trade. The ShapeShift solution should ease that burden a bit.

ShapeShift does not control these gas fees (they depend on market demand for the Ethereum network), but FOX Tokens now have the added power of helping you pay for gas when you trade on ShapeShift. 

10% of the value of your FOX Tokens can be repaid to you each month for gas costs on trades. With enough FOX tokens, this can potentially offset all of your gas costs on trades. 

FOX Fuel replenishes 30 days after its used. (while also earning more FOX when you trade). 

## How It Works

Every 30 days, 10% of your FOX Tokens' market value as decided by CoinCap.io at the time of transaction, are  refunded to you in FOX to assist in covering for the high gas expenses.

Since we charge no commissions, provide you with FOX Tokens on every trade, and help pay gas fees, trading with ShapeShift gives you more value than trading directly with a DEX. Stated differently, it is now always better to trade through ShapeShift than directly through a DEX.

Example: If you are holding $50 worth of FOX, then you are eligible to receive $5 worth of FOX tokens reimbursed each month for the gas fees spent your trades. If you are holding $550 of FOX, you can be reimbursed $55 each month for gas fees (and so on). 

The FOX Fuel reward is calculated and rewarded when the trade is completed, and the benefit refreshes 30 days after each trade.
