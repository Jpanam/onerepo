<h1>What is an HD Wallet?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p>Some wallets, such as KeepKey or Mycelium, are<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet">HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets</a></strong>. This means that the wallet generates a new address once you use the receive address. However, you can continue to reuse receive addresses as they are still linked to your private key. Cryptoassets that having these changing addresses include (but are not limited to): BTC,BCH, and LTC.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that <strong>you can</strong> use any of your previous addresses to receive funds.</p></div>
